# Initializing

First of all, you should make a folder for your new project, either from your file manager or using the `mkdir` command.

Crystal comes with a tool to initialize an app or a shard/package.

Usage: `crystal init TYPE (DIR | NAME DIR)`

Since you are building a Discord Bot, you are going to initialize that folder you previously made as an app, using: `crystal init app /path/to/folder/`.

> Note: `TYPE` and `DIR` are required.

This will create the base structure or skeleton of your project.
